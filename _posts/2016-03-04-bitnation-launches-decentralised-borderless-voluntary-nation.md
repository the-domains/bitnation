description: 'Bitnation, the blockchain-based system of notarisation and personal sovereignty, has launched its Decentralised Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN) Constitution using Ethereum. Ethereum offers anyone the chance to establish their own democratic autonomous organisation (DAO), making it a good match for Bitnation, which is taking that idea to another level yet.'
