description: "BITNATION is a decentralized, open-source movement, powered by the Bitcoin blockchain 2.0 technology, in an attempt to foster a peer-to-peer voluntary governance system, rather than the current 'top-down', 'one-size-fits-all' model, restrained by the current nation-state engineered geographical apartheid, where your quality of life is defined by where you were arbitrarily born."
